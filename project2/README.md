## Project 2

Collaboration between Tellef Storebakken (@tellefs), Julian E. Vevik (@jvevik) and Maria L. Markova (@sagora123 / @markmarko).


Programs task_a.py, task_b.py, task_c.py, task_d.py and task_e.py were used for collecting the results for the project.
With the current settings chosen in the programs:

	1. task_a_py runs a simple analysis of the training and test MSE for ridge with lambda=0.001, stochastic gradient descent with 1000 epochs and constant eta=0.001.

	2. task_b.py runs the self-made FFNN with three hidden layers (50 neurons each) with 1000 epochs, eta=0.001 and lambda=0.001 (ridge case)

	3. task_c.py runs the self-made NN with one hidden layer (50 neurons) with 1000 epochs, eta=0.001 and tanh activation function for the hidden layers.

	4. task_d.py runs the self-made FFNN with three hidden layers (50 neurons each) with 100 epochs, eta=0.01 and lambda=0.001 (ridge case) for the classification problem.

	5. task_e.py runs logistic regresion with stochastic gradient descent with 100 epochs and eta=0.01.

	Keras NN for the classification case is placed in project_2.ipynb
