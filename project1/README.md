# Project 1:

The task description can be read in the project1-tasks.pdf file

The final report with all latex files and figures used can be found in the folder "Latex",
where the final report is the "project1-report.pdf" file.

The main code is found in the Jupyter Notebook file project1.ipynb. This is a interactive notebook,
which has been run with values to show the results used in our report. It illustrates how we
achieved our results. It is also very easy to change parameters in this modular notebook, if anything needs testing. Since our code is on this notebook form, this can be used for testing,
and thus we elected not to include a testing folder. 
NB! If unable to load the notebook directly in GitHub, the website https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ works very well for viewing notebooks, all you need to do is copy the URL to the Notebook.


The figures generated by this notebook can be found in the folder "figures"

The terrain .tif data filde used for the analysis can be found in the folder "Datafiles"

The .csv files generated by the notebook can be found in the "terrain_data" folder.

Collaboration between @tellefs and @jvevik.
